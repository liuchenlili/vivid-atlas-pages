        I am a master's student in Computer Technology at Zhejiang Gongshang University, specializing in knowledge graphs and artificial intelligence. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Henan Polytechnic University, where I built a solid foundation in algorithms and engineering implementation.
        My research focuses on the integration of large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs, particularly exploring multi-feature fusion techniques for knowledge representation and semantic retrieval. My first-author paper, “Multi-Feature Fusion Strategies for Enhancing Knowledge Graph Embedding,” has been accepted by IEEE Big Data 2025.
        In terms of engineering practice, I am proficient in backend technologies such as Spring Boot, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Docker, with hands-on experience in distributed and microservice development. I independently designed and implemented an LLM-based intelligent knowledge base system.
        I am passionate about combining artificial intelligence with real-world applications, aiming to develop efficient and trustworthy data intelligence systems.
